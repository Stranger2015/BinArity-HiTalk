#HITALK
HiTalk is the standalone compiler for the Logtalk language that is enhanced with the HiLog features. It is assumed that all the backend Prolog implementations which are supported by the original Logtalk 3.X version implemented by Paulo Moura as the transpiler to Prolog ( source language is also Prolog ), are also supported by HiTalk.
